1.3) FAQ:
Q: May I use and distribute screenshots/videos on social media & game stores if I buy these assets?
A: As soon as there are screenshots for a project publicly shown, the license for the assetpack is automatically tied to the project shown. This acknowledged, screenshots and videos may be shared.
(3.1A, 3.1B)

Q: May I enhance / change / alter graphics?
A: If you want to edit the graphics, this licence allows you to do so, although every edit or enhancement will be handled as „derivative work“ and may not be redistributed/sublicensed (3.1C, 5)

Q: May I use the assets in a crowdfunding campaign?
A: The assets may be used in screenshots and trailers for crowdfunding campaigns (3.1A)
In newsletters and crowdfunding sites only as a part of a screenshots/video (3.1 A)
Although not as part of logos, headers, newsletter decoration, parts of the crowdfunding site (3.2B, 3.2D)

Q: May I use the assets in an “App” or ”Movie” which is not specifically a ”Game“?
A: The assets may be used in Apps/Movies which are not specifically games, but work like games. 
E.G. if you make a learning app and want to use the menu set that‘s ok. (2, „Media Product“)
However if you build an engine or any app which delivers the assets as elements to build something from it – namely you sub distribute them, this is not allowed within the confinements of this licence. (3.2A, 3.2C, 3.2D)

Q: May I use the assets for printed media?
A: No, this licence doesn‘t include rights for anything else than a digital usage.

Q: May the assets be printed by press e.g. in a magazine?
A: If a third party should make a press-feature of your product, this doesn’t interfere in any way with this license.

Q: May I print the assets on a product box or user manual?
As long as they are part of screenshots this is also not a problem

Q: May I print the assets on objects (crowdfunding rewards e.g. T-shirts, Cups etc.)?
No, this licence exclusively grants right for ingame-use and screenshots / trailers
 
Q: How should I credit the artist?
A: If you used or bought assets, the best is to simply refer to the asset store / or credit (3.2D)
However If you bought assets, the artist is in no form liable for your project and not part of your art team. E.G.: if you make a crowdfunding campaign, the artist is not part of the project team. (3.3A)

Q: What does it exactly mean that the licence is tied to a single project?
The licence for a project usually counts for “release” or earlier in a project’s lifetime during a “crowdfunding campaign”. 
If you simply use the assets for playing around with different prototypes that is simply prototyping and game-development. 
However if you make a trailer, a bunch of screenshots and market your game, the licence you bought will be tied to that project.

Q: May I use any of the art in combination with any blockchain technologies?
No. The licenses of the asset store doesn’t allow you permission to use the art in conjunction with blockchain technologies and by buying a license you don’t get the rights needed to redistribute the assets and using them in conjunction with blockchain technologies is at the core an intended use for redistribution. This is a violation of my copyrights.
