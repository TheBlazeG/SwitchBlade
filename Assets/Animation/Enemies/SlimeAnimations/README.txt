This is a very small free asset pack. You'll find a bunch of animations for a Slime I made long ago, this was just a test to begin making asset packs for itch.io

• Red Slime Jump Animation
• Red Slime Idle Animation
• Red Slime Attack Animation
• Red Slime Death Animation

• Blue Slime Jump Animation
• Blue Slime Idle Animation
• Blue Slime Attack Animation
• Red Slime Death Animation

• Green Slime Jump Animation

All animations are saved in gif and png!

NOTE: Ignore the "itchio" folder. These are edits of the assets used for the presentation on Itch.io
You may use the assets inside of it, but they are not properly crafted for games.
